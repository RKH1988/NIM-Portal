# NIM-portal

## Description
Nonprofits are paying astronomical amounts of money to have interactive portals that allow them to communicate with their donors and future donors. There is a shortage in the free app space that allows a donor to communicate with their nonprofit account manager and for an account manager to communicate with their assigned donors. This application, The NIM Portal (Nonprofit Interactive Messaging Portal), will bridge that gap. A free application that allows donors to sign up on a nonprofit’s NIM Portal to create a dialogue with someone that can manage their giving preferences. Donors will be able to communicate about upcoming pledges, update their contact information and even make a donation, all from one place. And what’s most important, the account manager will have a running record of all communication with any particular donor, eliminating the need to create contact reports in their database.
