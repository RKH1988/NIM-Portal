      <h1>Our Purpose</h1>
      <p>
        Here at the Nonprofit Interactive Messaging Portal, or the NIM Portal, we want to help users with communications 
        and donations with nonprofit organizations.
      </p>
      <h1>Our Story</h1>
      <p>
        Our creators realize that nonprofit organizations are paying large amounts of money to have interactive portals 
        that allow them to communicate with their donors and future donors. This site will bridge the gap between donors and
        account managers of nonprofit organizations.
      </p>
      <h1>How It All Works</h1>
      <p>
        Donors are able to communicate about upcoming pledges, update their contact information and even make a donation all
        from one place. Account managers will have a running record of all communication, with any particular donor, 
        eliminating the need to create contact reports in their database.
      </p>
